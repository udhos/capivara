What is X88 in computing chess ?

0x88 is a board representation & move generation system. Here is how it
works.

A chess board is ordinarily 8 ranks high by 8 files wide. In this system
you make the board 16 files wide, but the right-most files are ignored,
I'll explain why they exist shortly.

You number the squares 0..127. a1 is 0, b1 is 1, a2 is 16, h8 is 135,
etc.

To generate the moves for a sliding piece you have a "square offset"
number that you use to get to the next square on the pieces' movement
vector. For instance, a bishop on c3 can move upward and to the right,
toward h8. You start with c3 and add 17 squares to get to d4, then 17
more to get to e5, until you either hit something or run off the board.

The idea behind 0x88 move generation is that it is easy to tell if you
have run off the board. All you do is AND the proposed new square number
with 0x88 and see if you have anything left over. If you do, you've run
off the board. The idea is that if you are on the H-file, and try to move
to the I-file, the 8's bit will be set in the resulting square number. If
you are on rank 8 and try to move to rank 9, the 128's bit will be set.
The same thing happens if you try to move to rank 0 or whatever you want
to call the file to the left of the A-file.

You end up with a loop that looks like this:

for (;;) {
isq += 17;
if (isq & 0x88)
break;
// In here you check to see if you are capturing a piece,
// or conflicting with one of your own pieces, or are just
// moving to a square, and either generate a move, break
// out of here, or both, as appropriate.
}

This loop ends up being very fast.

There is another benefit to this technique as well, you can use it to make
a fast "in check" function, among other things.

If you take the difference between any two squares on the board, you get a
number, either positive or negative. This number relates the two squares
in a manner that you can actually use. If A is 17 greater than B, A is
above and to the right of B. If it is one less than B, it is one square
to the left of B. If it is 14 more than B, it is two squares left and one
above B (a knight's move).

In an 8 by 8 board, you can't do this. If you subtract A from B and get
one, it MAY be true that B is one square to the right of A, but this
assumption is not ALWAYS true. The counter-example is if B is a4 and A is
h3. B - A is 1, but B is NOT one square to the right of A, it is
somewhere else, in an 8 x 8 board things can "wrap around". This can't
happen in a 16 x 8 board.

That you can subtract two squares and get a number that describes their
relationship is USEFUL. You can take this difference number, offset it by
128 so it's always >= 0, and indirect into a table. The value in the
table is a bitmask that describes what kind of piece can make a move
between two squares that relate in this manner. So in the element of this
table that corresponds to 17 (one up and to the right), you get QUEEN |
BISHOP | KING, or something like that.

In an in-check function, what you want to do is figure out if a particular
piece can attack the king. You would look up the relationship between the
square the piece is on and the square the king is on in this table, and
see if the bit for this piece type is set. If it is not set, you can't
get there from here, and you can move on to your next piece. If it is
set, in the case of a non-sliding piece (knight or king), you are DONE.
In the case of a sliding piece, you still have to walk the vector to see
if there are any interposing pieces, but this won't happen very often,
most often the bitmask in the table will discriminate for you.

I don't know which programs are using 0x88, but I suspect that many very
good ones are.

I hope the above was understandable.
